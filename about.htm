Detroit city government leaders - mayors like Kwame Kilpatrick; 
city council members like JoAnn Watson, Alberta Tinsley-Talabi, Barbra Rose Collins, Kwame Kenyatta, Kay Everett, Alonzo Bates, Gil Hill, Monica Conyers and Nicholas Hood; 
and department directors like Ella Bully-Cummings, Charles Beckham and Walt Watkins - control 
12,000 employees and a yearly budget of $3,100,000,000.  The Detroit Public Schools have an additional 12,593 employees and a yearly budget of $1,237,000,000.
(In April of 2012, the City agreed to the Governor's consent aggreement which will restructure city government.)
<p></p>
For decades, Detroit's leaders have been saying they've been doing a good job serving the residents of Detroit.
<p></p>
detroitmetrics.org is a web site that gives people hard data to measure, in fact, how city leaders are doing.
<p></p>
detroitmetrics.org is an information system created by Andrew Koper to apply the power of the 
Internet to solve Detroit's social problems and make the world a better place.
<p></p>
Michigan has 9,800,000 residents and a GDP of $384,000,000,000.*  The United States has a population of
312,000,000 and a GDP of $15,320,000,000,000.**  There is a lot riding on this; there is a lot of 
money in America and more of it will flow into Detroit when things are done well.
<p></p>
The code developed here can be applied to other places and units of goverment.  Workers can
input their work with a <a href="form.htm">form like this</a>.
<p></p>
Public corporations have their stock price, which reflects how they are doing, charted every day.
Why not do the same thing for public places and leaders?
<p></p>
There are over 40 columns and 40 rows (1,600 data points) in the database, but the data is patchy 
because different agencies (US Bureau of Economic Analysis, City of Detroit Budget Dept., etc.) 
have made different types of information public for different time frames.
<p></p>
The next step is for the government agencies that collect the data - the Detroit Police Department, 
Detroit Building, Safety & Engineering Dept., US Census Bureau, etc -
to expose their data on their servers - create an API - so that 
this graphing application can query it directly from the primary sources.

Below is a diagram that shows how the application works.
